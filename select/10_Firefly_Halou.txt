I've got a bug inside and it is just a little housefly.
I got a bug inside it tickles like a butterfly.
I've got a worm that's mine and crawls around my whole inside.
And when I dont feel right it feels just like a parasite.

A bug, get it!
A bug, kill it!

And you will never know how it feels to light up the sky.
And you will never know how it feels to be a firefly.

My body is a jar for a special insect caught inside it.
Sometimes it lights me up but I would never let you know it.
Sometimes it crawls around and makes me laugh when I am down.
I dont wanna let it out yet I am greedy little bug.

A bug, kill it!
A bug, get it!

And you will never know how it feels to light up the sky.
And you will never know how it feels to be a firefly.

Sometimes I look for a safe place to keep my little bug.
Sometimes it flutters around trapped and I feel so sad.
But I know what would happen if I ever let go of it.
I think that this cruel world would surely kill it.

A bug, kill it!
A bug, get it!

And you will never know how it feels to light up the sky.
And you will never know how it feels to be a firefly.
And you will never know how it feels to light up the night.
And you will never know how it feels to be a firefly.
