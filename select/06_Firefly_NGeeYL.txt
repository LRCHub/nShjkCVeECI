Yeah, yeah
Y'all got... ...over there
Mmm

Like a firefly, I'ma shine (On God)
Like a skateboarder (Bitch), I'ma grind (I'ma grind)
I've been in fucked up situations from time to time (Time to time)
But that mula only thing on my mind (Gang, gang)
Free Lil Mula, he go brazy with that 9 (Free Lil Mula)
Hope my dogs turn up, they some canines (Dogs)
Pull up on ya with a baby MP5
Let that mothafucka ring, hit your eyes

Bad bitch and she got some big-ass thighs
She say, "Why, you don't lie?" (The fuck?)
'Cause baby, I'm real
I've been ballin' on these niggas, I got skills
Ain't no Call of Duty, but bitch, I'm tryna catch a kill
Spin your block like ferris wheel
(We gon' spin that bitch, on my mama)
They say young YL, he weird (Yeah)
Why he don't fuck with these rappers?
'Cause most of the time with these niggas, I'm tryna clap 'em
Can't bring my lil' homeboy 'round
Them niggas 'cause they gon' strip 'em
I be with them big dogs, call them niggas Clifford
I don't know you, though, ballin' on you, though
Pull up with a 7.62, bro got a .44
You already know, when it hit, it knock off your nose
You better stay on your toes when you
Get shot like free throws (On God, you dig?)
Bad bitch with pretty feet (You bitch)
And that bitch pussy too pink (You bitch)
I don't even know what to think (I don't)
Percocets got me geeked (Percocets)
Percocets put me to sleep (Percocets)
Nah, I'm really lyin', though (On cap)
I don't get no sleep at all (I don't)
Too busy tryna ball
Too busy tryna figure it out
Too busy tryna make it out
Too busy tryna buy my mama
One fuckin' two-million dollar house
Pull up, we'll air that shit out (We'll air it out)
Pull up, we wavin' it now (Air it our, air it out, air it out)
Y'all niggas really clowns (Air it out, air it out, air it out)

Like a firefly, I'ma shine (On God)
Like a skateboarder (Bitch), I'ma grind (I'ma grind)
I've been in fucked up situations from time to time (Time to time)
But that mula only thing on my mind (Gang, gang)
Free Lil Mula, he go brazy with that 9 (Free Lil Mula)
Hope my dogs turn up, they some canines (Dogs)
Pull up on ya with a baby MP5 (Gang, gang)
Let that mothafucka ring, hit your eyes (Eyes, eyes)

Bad bitch and she got some big-ass thighs
She say, "Why, you don't lie?" (The fuck?)
'Cause baby, I'm real
