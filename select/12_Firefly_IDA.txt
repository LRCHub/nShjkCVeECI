Always more than I can catch inside this jar
Lighting up the night sky
Flicker in your eye
Ladybugs crawl across your hand
In plain sight, broad daylight
I don't mind

But in the dark
Invisible and beautiful
Then gone again
When you've forgotten them
They're back again
On and off
On and off
On and off

Only a fool tries to follow the light of a firefly
