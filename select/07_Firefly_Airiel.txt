Hey, say you want me
Don't you want me?
Hey, I feel madly, I feel badly

The flame, the fire, the darklight
The chase erased by midnight
The sheet, the breeze, the slumber
The sweet embrace you offer
The spy, the glove, the footstep
The diary that she kept
The hint, the sigh, the weakness
What did you get yourself in?

Hey, it's not over
Come on over
Hey, I feel madly, I feel badly
Hey, it's not over
Come on over
Hey, say you want me
Don't you want me?

I can show you how to win it all
I can tell you wanna win it all
What's the way you want to play?

A firefly can guide you
A firefly can guide you
