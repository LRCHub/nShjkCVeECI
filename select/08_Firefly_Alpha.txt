Who begins a star?
Who will roll far?
Took the way I know
Move along now

So sad I lost my memory
The shape of things to come
Circus heart stops inside me
There's just no time.

Halcyon days
Pine the roadways
Got to let you know
And I walk the way the wind blows
Softly in clouds of envy
I see those eyes
Fireflies in time

Don't ask for anything more
There seem no room in my life
Don't ask for anything more
Don't know why

Talk to me
Drag my memory
Across a seashore of sin
Yes I care
I'm trying to say it
I'm getting tired, so look
I'll never
I'll never
Whenever

Hold your hand, hold the light
Indian took another butterfly
Anything cloud nor dirt
Funny bird
Burning words
Travelling
Dreams for me
In time.

Heads down
Words from an indian
Words tinny in tone

Destiny on tow

Travelling
Dreams for me
In time.

Heads down
Words from an indian
Words tinny in tone
