Pavement's turning into gold
And it's risin' up into my eyes
Up on my back I feel the static and more
Tripping the wire, surrounded in time

I see this as mystical
I'm sure that you know

See this as mystical
I'm sure that you know

Just say
You'll be my firefly
Take everything or nothing at all

Just say
You'll be my firefly
Take everything or nothing at all

Just say "yes"
Just say "yes"
Just say
"I'd rather have everything than nothing at all"

Just say "yes"

Sorry I've got none to pose
Images I pictured inside
Everything I've tried to close
Carrying the weight on my back I feel the static and more
Tripping the wire, surrounded in time

I see this as mystical
I'm sure that you know

See this as mystical
I'm sure that you know

Just say
You'll be my firefly
Take everything or nothing at all

Just say
You'll be my firefly
Take everything or nothing at all

Just say "yes"
Just say "yes"
Just say
"I'd rather have everything than nothing at all"

Just say "yes"
